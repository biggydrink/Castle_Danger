Castle Danger begins with you entering your character name. Once you do, you enter the game world in the 
starter zone, and you have a choice of four exits—north, south, east, and west. Each of these choices has 
a number of rooms in that direction, followed by a boss that will give you some items. The difficult order,
starting with the easiest, is north, east, south, then west.

The commands in this game are as follows:

•	n 			:	Move to the north
•	s			:	Move to the south
•	e			:	Move to the east
•	w			:	Move to the west
•	attack			:	Attack a monster in the room
•	look (or lowercase L)	:	Look at the room you’re in
•	look [item]		:	Look at an item in your inventory or that you have equipped
•	inventory (or inv)	:	Get a list of your inventory of items
•	equip			:	Get a list of what items you have equipped
•	equip [item]		:	Equip an item from your inventory
•	unequip [item]		:	Unequip an item you currently have equipped
•	use [item]		:	Use a one-time item, such as a potion
•	drop [item]		:	Drop an item from your inventory (you can’t get it back) 
•	stats			:	See your current stats—HP, Attack, and Defense

The goal is to explore all the areas and beat all the bosses. But the real point was to learn how to 
code everything, so sorry if it’s not much fun yet.
